# Overview

I've developed a score-tracking app that allows users to manage scores for a game involving six players. 

The purpose behind creating this app was to further my skills as a software engineer, particularly in Android app development using Jetpack Compose. This project aimed to enhance my understanding of state management within Compose and integrating persistent data storage using SharedPreferences in Android apps.

To see a demonstration of the app's functionality and a walkthrough of the code, please check out the following YouTube video:

# Development Environment

The app was developed using the following tools and languages:

- Development Tools: Android Studio
- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Libraries/Frameworks: Jetpack Compose, Android SharedPreferences

# Future Work

There are several areas for future improvements and enhancements for the app, such as:

- Implementing user authentication for multiple scoreboards
- Adding a history feature to track score changes over time
- Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements and animations
